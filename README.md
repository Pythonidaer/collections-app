# collections-app

The main goal of this app is to display a user's Instagram Collections.

Photos and Videos can be saved. These can be saved in folders called Collections.

Lately I have been saving a lot of content, and organizing the items by body part. Since my goal is to strengthen a lot of weak areas in my body for boxing, I thought it would be nice to make an app that improves my programming skills, while potentially becoming something I could use to both improve my health and showcase my technical abilities.
